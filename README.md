What is a Table in HTML?
A table is a representation of data arranged in rows and columns. Really, it's more like a spreadsheet. In HTML, with the help of tables, you can arrange data like images, text, links and so on into rows and columns of cells.

The use of tables in the web has become more popular recently because of the amazing HTML table tags that make it easier to create and design them.

To create a table in HTML you will need to use tags. The most important one is the <table> tag which is the main container of the table. It shows where the table will begin and where it ends.

Common HTML Table tags
Other tags include:

<tr> - represents rows
<td> - used to create data cells
<th> - used to add table headings
<caption> - used to insert captions
<thead> - adds a separate header to the table
<tbody> - shows the main body of the table
<tfoot> - creates a separate footer for the table

The <th> is used to add headings to tables. In basic designs the table heading will always take the top row, meaning we will have the <th> declared in our first table row followed by the actual data in the table. By default the text passed in the Heading is centered and Bold.

The main use of adding a caption to table is to provide a description about the data represented in the table. The caption can either be placed at the top of the table or the bottom and by default it will always be centered.

To insert a caption into a table, use the <caption> tag.
